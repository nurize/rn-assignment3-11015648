An assignment on ReactNative Mobile App Development. 
It includes accessing UI designs from Figma. 
It allows students to be creative and harnesses our problem-solving skills. 

## Description of the React Native Components

**View:**

* The most fundamental building block in React Native UI. It represents a container that can hold other components and define layout. You can think of it as a box that can hold other UI elements. Views can have styles applied to them using `StyleSheet`.

**Text:**

* Used to display text on the screen. You can set the text content, styling (font size, color, etc.), and how many lines of text to display.

**ScrollView:**

* Enables scrolling content horizontally or vertically within its designated space. It's useful when you have more content than can fit on the screen at once.

**TextInput:**

* A component that allows users to input text. You can define placeholders, set keyboard types (numeric, email, etc.), and handle text changes through events.

**StyleSheet:**

* A way to define styles for your React Native components. Styles are typically defined as objects containing properties like `backgroundColor`, `fontSize`, `padding`, etc. You can then reference these styles by name in your components using the `style` prop.

**Button:**

* Creates a clickable button that can trigger actions when pressed. You can customize the button text, styles, and onPress events.

**FlatList:**

* Used for displaying efficient, vertically scrolling lists of data. It renders items lazily as they come into view, making it suitable for large datasets. It requires providing data and a way to render each item.

**SectionList:**

* Similar to FlatList but allows grouping data into sections with section headers. Useful for displaying data categorized into groups, like a contact list with sections for different alphabets. It requires providing data with sections and ways to render items and section headers.
